*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:
       The fourth task This project involved building a simple e-learning platform using basic HTML and CSS. The main goal was to create a two-page layout. The first page displays available courses, while the second page shows course details, including video content and progress tracking.

The homepage is designed to feature a title at the top, followed by navigation links and a list of courses. Each course appears in a box that includes a heading, a short description, and a link to view the full course. Three sample courses are included: HTML Basics, CSS for Beginners, and JavaScript Essentials.

The second page serves as the course detail page. It also has a title and navigation at the top. Below that, the course description appears. A sample video is embedded beneath the description to simulate a video lesson. After the video section, a progress bar displays how much of the course has been completed.

Progress is shown in two ways. First, a line of text indicates the percentage, such as “Progress: 60%.” Below it, a horizontal bar displays the filled portion visually. The width of the filled bar adjusts using inline styling in the HTML, without any JavaScript.

Styling is applied with an external CSS file. The design is simple and clean. The light background contrasts with dark text for readability. The top section features a dark background with white text, highlighting the platform name and making the navigation more visible.

Course boxes are styled with a light border and padding to set them apart from other content. Margins create space between them. The layout is vertical, so everything stacks clearly on top of each other, allowing for easy navigation without advanced layout techniques.

For the progress bar, a simple horizontal container serves as the background. Inside that container, another bar of a different color shows the progress level. The width of this filled section is adjusted manually to match the displayed percentage.

This entire design was created without using any advanced CSS features. There were no flexbox, grid, animations, media queries, or JavaScript included. The project relies solely on basic layout and styling methods, such as colors, spacing, borders, and font sizes. Navigation occurs by linking between the two HTML pages.

In summary, this project shows how to create a basic multi-page e-learning interface using only beginner-level HTML and CSS. It features a course listing, simple navigation, embedded video content, and a manual progress indicator. The structure is clear, easy to read, and ready to expand if needed.
