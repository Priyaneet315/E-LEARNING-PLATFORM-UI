*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*:
       The fourth task was to design a basic front-end interface for an e-learning platform using only HTML and CSS. The main goal was to create a multi-page layout that includes course listings, course details, progress tracking, and embedded video support. This would demonstrate how an e-learning platform might look and work from a user's perspective without using any complex design techniques.

The first step was to create the homepage (index.html). This page serves as the course listing screen, allowing users to see a list of available courses. For simplicity, three sample courses were included: HTML Basics, CSS for Beginners, and JavaScript Essentials. Each course has a brief description and a link to the course detail page. This layout simulates a real platform where students can browse available content.

After the homepage was ready, a second page called course.html was developed. This page displays the course detail view. It provides more information about a specific course, in this case, HTML Basics. The page begins with a brief description of what the user will learn. Below that, a sample video is embedded using the basic <video> tag, showing that learning content can be delivered visually, as is common on e-learning platforms.

Following the video section is a simple progress tracking system. Since no JavaScript or backend was permitted, progress is shown manually with a progress bar made using HTML and CSS. A container <div> represents the full progress bar, and a smaller inner <div> with a defined width (like 60%) visually indicates the userâ€™s current progress in the course.

For styling, a basic CSS file (style.css) was created. The design is minimal and uses standard HTML tags. No flexbox, grid, or JavaScript was implemented. Color choices create a clean and readable look, with a dark header and light background. Boxes are made with borders and padding to clearly separate each section.

Overall, the front-end interface is interactive in terms of navigation and structure. Users can navigate between pages by clicking the links. The content is organized and easy to read, even with simple code. This project provided insight into how basic HTML and CSS can be used to create a usable and informative website layout. It also offered practical experience in structuring multi-page applications and embedding multimedia content.

The deliverable is a styled and interactive front-end that features course listings, navigation, embedded video, and a progress display. It is ready to be expanded in the future by adding forms, user login, quizzes, or dynamic features using JavaScript or backend tools.
